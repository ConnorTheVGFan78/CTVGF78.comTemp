<h1>NEW WEBSITE COMING SOON!!!</h1>

<div>
<p>Hello all, Connor here. You are on this page because I am currently in the process of migrating to a new website.</p>
<p>I realized that Wordpress wasn't the best platform to host my website on <b>ESPESCIALLY SINCE I ACTUALLY TRIED ACCESSING IT WHILE SIGNED OUT OF MY WORDPRESS AND GOT GREETED BY A SIGN-IN PAGE!!!</b></p>
<p>Seeing how my own fucking domain could be mistaken for a phishing link because of this poor choice in design by my web host, I am now in the process of moving ConnorTheVGFan78.com to a new host, one that gives me more freedom and one that <b>won't ask people to sign in to access because that is unacceptable.</b></p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>
